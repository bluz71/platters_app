Two tokens strategy:

Access Token - short lived (30 mins)
  - If server responds with 401 (unauthorized) then get a new access token by
    submitting the existing refresh token to a specific endpoint
Refresh Token - longer lived (1 week)

Instead of 2 tokens, have 1 token with two fields
  - exp (long)
  - lastAuth (short)
